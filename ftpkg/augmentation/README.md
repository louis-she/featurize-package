## Augmentation
To prevent overfitting, we tend to increase the size of the datasets. However we may not be able to get that sufficient data for some particular task. 

Image augmentations is crutial when this situation occurs. The model performance is highly related to the augmentation method for many oriented tasks.

We wrapped some of the commonly used augmentation methods within this package and thanks to the great contribution of the team from https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations.

With below command you can add this package to Featurize.
```
featurize package:add ftpkg.augmentation
```
Enjoy it!
